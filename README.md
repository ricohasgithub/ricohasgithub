### Hello Everybody! 👋

I'm Rico Zhu (he/him/his), and I recently graduated from Duke University with a double major in CS and Math. I do research in interpretable machine learning (specifically to design better generative models for science discovery), as well as in deep learning theory. Feel free to [ping me](mailto:rico.zhu@duke.edu "my email") if you want to collaborate!
