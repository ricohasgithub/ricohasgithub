### Hello Everybody! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Rico Zhu (he/him/his), a senior at Duke University double majoring in CS and Math. I do research in interpretable machine learning (specifically in interpretable generative models), as well as geometric and topological deep learning.! I'm currently working on a few personal projects, but definitely feel free to [ping me](mailto:rico.zhu@duke.edu "my email") if you want to collaborate!
