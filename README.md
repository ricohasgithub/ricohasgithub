### Hello Everybody! ðŸ‘‹

Apparently you can make ReadMe bios on Github now, which is pretty wild. So I'm Rico Zhu (he/him/his), a freshman at Duke University who loves to learn and program! I'm currently working on a few personal projects, but definitely feel free to [ping me](mailto:rico.zhu@duke.edu "my email") if you want to collaborate!

###### ðŸ˜Ž Fun Fact: I once got my tongue stuck to a fence (fun times)
###### ðŸ‘€ 2nd Fun Fact: I also have an [instagram page](https://instagram.com/ricohacks) dedicated to my hackathon shenanigans where I occasionally post some pretty quality content
